"With beautiful Background score, Cinematography, Action and direction, the movie is a treat for Mass fans across India with heavy power packed dialogues filled with all sorts of emotions. What seems like a Rocky's celebration has layers when looked closely. There are characters who want Rocky to win in the end and have made him easier to do do, That certainly gives an idea of how the past and uture story unveils in KGF Chapter 2. Enjoyed the movie with all heart :). Good luck and love to team KGF!"

"What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2."

"Let me tell you the truth ... I'm rating this movie 9/10
Why less 0.5.... Only for ... Extra brilliance of the director who narrated this film in multi dimensional advanced version... For which Kannada audience are not ready yet...Story starts with a interview in a press premises secretly of a author/ Ananth sir.. For why government wants to ban on his work \"
Now the actual story starts within that four walls .... That will be your eyes n ears... To climax...
Thou\"/ it seems within this understanding
Still
There is another angle to it \"a local reporter goes on recording in writing from ordinary man who knows about mumbai rowdy Rocky\"...
Out of that four walls (actually isn't)......One should gave little bit more attention to the narration then you will swim in kgfs ocean.... easily or else you may have to watch it in better screenHero's mother character (from a small village near Mysore called baira) is still kept a secret in chapter 1... Who why where when what to whom all ... It may unfold only chapter 2Who is surya vardhan(from kgf???) \" who invents gold in kgf\"... Needs little details in ..chapter 2.
I bet every character is in this film will haunts you... Main to small they all have same importance n significance ... n bike n drinks bottles in first half or hand written story telling posters in second half...No unnecessary hype to Hero character.... The force n content of the film is such that one can feel his presence in such a manner...
Heroin.... Character strikes at first sight
From Vashista to Suresh
Or Achyuth to children characters ... Will occupy your imaginations....
No nonsense scene or characters u may come across\"BGM n songs .... Are well thought crafted..each characters have their own signature sounds in this movie ...
and special about the songs are come only in background and are situational don't have lip sinking scenes except the item song .. at the par with Hollywood standard...... Grueling sound of kgf villain character or eagles sound like craft for hero are just osmCinematography ....
Bow one word ... Not justified
I've seen many big English franchise n few Chinese movie makers of this level....
Entire movie seems to be rushing on screen but it is deliberately done master craft... Just you need a sophisticated screen n sound systems
To experience it.... Blink u gone it\"
Which pulls you to the edges of the seats
From beaches of Mumbai to streets of then Bangalore to dark n dust of kgf forbidden hills\" let it be
Aerial to underground shots ... WowProduction....
No vfx... It is real n actual story telling film
Any fool can estimate n feel it on screen ..Direction...
He is from other planet.... If not India
We all should be proud he is from our Karnataka......
Words can't explain his work... Any film lover will admire n Adore his work after watching kgf film"

The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2."

"Let me tell you the truth ... I'm rating this movie 9/10
Why less 0.5.... Only for ... Extra brilliance of the director who narrated this film in multi dimensional advanced version... For which Kannada audience are not ready yet...Story starts with a interview in a press premises secretly of a author/ Ananth sir.. For why government wants to ban on his work \"
Now the actual story starts within that four walls .... That will be your eyes n ears... To climax...
Thou\"/ it seems within this understanding
Still
There is another angle to it \"a local reporter goes on recording in writing from ordinary man who knows about mumbai rowdy Rocky\"...
Out of that four walls (actually isn't)......One should gave little bit more attention to the narration then you will swim in kgfs ocean.... easily or else you may have to watch it in better screenHero's mother character (from a small village near Mysore called baira) is still kept a secret in chapter 1... Who why where when what to whom all ... It may unfold only chapter 2Who is surya vardhan(from kgf???) \" who invents gold in kgf\"... Needs little details in ..chapter 2.
I bet every character is in this film will haunts you... Main to small they all have same importance n significance ... n bike n drinks bottles in first half or hand written story telling posters in second half...No unnecessary hype to Hero character.... The force n content of the film is such that one can feel his presence in such a manner...
Heroin.... Character strikes at first sight
From Vashista to Suresh
Or Achyuth to children characters ... Will occupy your imaginations....
No nonsense scene or characters u may come across\"BGM n songs .... Are well thought crafted..each characters have their own signature sounds in this movie ...
and special about the songs are come only in background and are situational don't have lip sinking scenes except the item song .. at the par with Hollywood standard...... Grueling sound of kgf villain character or eagles sound like craft for hero are just osmCinematography ....
Bow one word ... Not justified
I've seen many big English franchise n few Chinese movie makers of this level....
Entire movie seems to be rushing on screen but it is deliberately done master craft... Just you need a sophisticated screen n sound systems
To experience it.... Blink u gone it\"
Which pulls you to the edges of the seats
From beaches of Mumbai to streets of then Bangalore to dark n dust of kgf forbidden hills\" let it be
Aerial to underground shots ... WowProduction....
No vfx... It is real n actual story telling film
Any fool can estimate n feel it on screen ..Direction...
He is from other planet.... If not India
We all should be proud he is from our Karnataka......
Words can't explain his work... Any film lover will admire n Adore his work after watching kgf film"

There are characters who want Rocky to win in the end and have made him easier to do do, That certainly gives an idea of how the past and uture story unveils in KGF Chapter 2.

"What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters.

No nonsense scene or characters u may come across\"BGM n songs .... Are well thought crafted..each characters have their own signature sounds in this movie ...
and special about the songs are come only in background and are situational don't have lip sinking scenes except the item song .. at the par with Hollywood standard...... Grueling sound of kgf villain character or eagles sound like craft for hero are just osmCinematography ....
Bow one word ... Not justified
I've seen many big English franchise n few Chinese movie makers of this level....
Entire movie seems to be rushing on screen but it is deliberately done master craft... Just you need a sophisticated screen n sound systems

"With beautiful Background score, Cinematography, Action and direction, the movie is a treat for Mass fans across India with heavy power packed dialogues filled with all sorts of emotions. What seems like a Rocky's celebration has layers when looked closely. There are characters who want Rocky to win in the end and have made him easier to do do, That certainly gives an idea of how the past and uture story unveils in KGF Chapter 2. Enjoyed the movie with all heart :). Good luck and love to team KGF!"

"What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2."

"Let me tell you the truth ... I'm rating this movie 9/10
Why less 0.5.... Only for ... Extra brilliance of the director who narrated this film in multi dimensional advanced version... For which Kannada audience are not ready yet...Story starts with a interview in a press premises secretly of a author/ Ananth sir.. For why government wants to ban on his work \"
Now the actual story starts within that four walls .... That will be your eyes n ears... To climax...
Thou\"/ it seems within this understanding
Still
There is another angle to it \"a local reporter goes on recording in writing from ordinary man who knows about mumbai rowdy Rocky\"...
Out of that four walls (actually isn't)......One should gave little bit more attention to the narration then you will swim in kgfs ocean.... easily or else you may have to watch it in better screenHero's mother character (from a small village near Mysore called baira) is still kept a secret in chapter 1... Who why where when what to whom all ... It may unfold only chapter 2Who is surya vardhan(from kgf???) \" who invents gold in kgf\"... Needs little details in ..chapter 2.
I bet every character is in this film will haunts you... Main to small they all have same importance n significance ... n bike n drinks bottles in first half or hand written story telling posters in second half...No unnecessary hype to Hero character.... The force n content of the film is such that one can feel his presence in such a manner...
Heroin.... Character strikes at first sight

Or Achyuth to children characters ... Will occupy your imaginations....

I found the entire movie held my interest.. this will definitely be the film you're looking for.. This film has numerous memorable scenes that verge on the hysterical including the yash in the gold Fields..

"What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2."

"Let me tell you the truth ... I'm rating this movie 9/10
Why less 0.5.... Only for ... Extra brilliance of the director who narrated this film in multi dimensional advanced version... For which Kannada audience are not ready yet...Story starts with a interview in a press premises secretly of a author/ Ananth sir.. For why government wants to ban on his work \"
Now the actual story starts within that four walls .... That will be your eyes n ears... To climax...
Thou\"/ it seems within this understanding
Still
There is another angle to it \"a local reporter goes on recording in writing from ordinary man who knows about mumbai rowdy Rocky\"...
Out of that four walls (actually isn't)......One should gave little bit more attention to the narration then you will swim in kgfs ocean.... easily or else you may have to watch it in better screenHero's mother character (from a small village near Mysore called baira) is still kept a secret in chapter 1... Who why where when what to whom all ... It may unfold only chapter 2Who is surya vardhan(from kgf???) \" who invents gold in kgf\"... Needs little details in ..chapter 2.
I bet every character is in this film will haunts you... Main to small they all have same importance n significance ... n bike n drinks bottles in first half or hand written story telling posters in second half...No unnecessary hype to Hero character.... The force n content of the film is such that one can feel his presence in such a manner...
Heroin.... Character strikes at first sight
From Vashista to Suresh
Or Achyuth to children characters ... Will occupy your imaginations....
No nonsense scene or characters u may come across\"BGM n songs .... Are well thought crafted..each characters have their own signature sounds in this movie ...
and special about the songs are come only in background and are situational don't have lip sinking scenes except the item song .. at the par with Hollywood standard...... Grueling sound of kgf villain character or eagles sound like craft for hero are just osmCinematography ....
Bow one word ... Not justified
I've seen many big English franchise n few Chinese movie makers of this level....
Entire movie seems to be rushing on screen but it is deliberately done master craft... Just you need a sophisticated screen n sound systems
To experience it.... Blink u gone it\"
Which pulls you to the edges of the seats
From beaches of Mumbai to streets of then Bangalore to dark n dust of kgf forbidden hills\" let it be
Aerial to underground shots ... WowProduction....
No vfx... It is real n actual story telling film
Any fool can estimate n feel it on screen ..Direction...
He is from other planet.... If not India
We all should be proud he is from our Karnataka......
Words can't explain his work... Any film lover will admire n Adore his work after watching kgf film"

There are characters who want Rocky to win in the end and have made him easier to do do, That certainly gives an idea of how the past and uture story unveils in KGF Chapter 2. Enjoyed the movie with all heart :). Good luck and love to team KGF!"

It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2."

"Let me tell you the truth ... I'm rating this movie 9/10
Why less 0.5.... Only for ... Extra brilliance of the director who narrated this film in multi dimensional advanced version... For which Kannada audience are not ready yet...Story starts with a interview in a press premises secretly of a author/ Ananth sir.. For why government wants to ban on his work \"
Now the actual story starts within that four walls .... That will be your eyes n ears... To climax...
Thou\"/ it seems within this understanding
Still
There is another angle to it \"a local reporter goes on recording in writing from ordinary man who knows about mumbai rowdy Rocky\"...
Out of that four walls (actually isn't)......One should gave little bit more attention to the narration then you will swim in kgfs ocean.... easily or else you may have to watch it in better screenHero's mother character (from a small village near Mysore called baira) is still kept a secret in chapter 1... Who why where when what to whom all ... It may unfold only chapter 2Who is surya vardhan(from kgf???) \" who invents gold in kgf\"... Needs little details in ..chapter 2.
I bet every character is in this film will haunts you... Main to small they all have same importance n significance ... n bike n drinks bottles in first half or hand written story telling posters in second half...No unnecessary hype to Hero character.... The force n content of the film is such that one can feel his presence in such a manner...
Heroin.... Character strikes at first sight
From Vashista to Suresh
Or Achyuth to children characters ... Will occupy your imaginations....
No nonsense scene or characters u may come across\"BGM n songs .... Are well thought crafted..each characters have their own signature sounds in this movie ...
and special about the songs are come only in background and are situational don't have lip sinking scenes except the item song .. at the par with Hollywood standard...... Grueling sound of kgf villain character or eagles sound like craft for hero are just osmCinematography ....
Bow one word ... Not justified
I've seen many big English franchise n few Chinese movie makers of this level....
Entire movie seems to be rushing on screen but it is deliberately done master craft... Just you need a sophisticated screen n sound systems
To experience it.... Blink u gone it\"
Which pulls you to the edges of the seats
From beaches of Mumbai to streets of then Bangalore to dark n dust of kgf forbidden hills\" let it be
Aerial to underground shots ... WowProduction....
No vfx... It is real n actual story telling film
Any fool can estimate n feel it on screen ..Direction...
He is from other planet.... If not India
We all should be proud he is from our Karnataka......
Words can't explain his work... Any film lover will admire n Adore his work after watching kgf film"

"I fall short of explaining how epic this movie is!!
This movie deserves to be the best movies 2018 in Indian cinema. Be it the emotions in film, action, direction, acting, songs, music everything is almost perfect.
This movie was successful to keep the audience to edge of the seats through out the movie.I am not going to ruin or spoil the show by revealing more about the movie!! If you love movies, then don't even think of missing this EPIC movie. This deserves to be watched on BIG SCREEN.I would have given 9 star, but i am giving 10 star because its coming from Kannada film industry. This is the first step by KFI to give world class Cinema. 1 extra star for directors and actors commitment and hard work. Total 10/10 from me"

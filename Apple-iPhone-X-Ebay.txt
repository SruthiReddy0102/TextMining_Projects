"Best value iPhone X 256GFast service and best value !!!  Switched from a 5s to a iPhone X with lots of memory. SIM card fit and start up software was simple. Backup your old phone on iCloud and keep it close to your new phone. Software uses Bluetooth and WiFi to do the rest. Did it all myself without tech support. Now I can run lots of apps and take pictures without fear of filling up my phone. Yes it is much larger than a 5s but it fits in my pocket. I love it.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: solutinter"
"It's a REAL beautiful, lovely little iPhone...It's a REAL beautiful, lovely little iPhone, absolutely, no question!But is it WORTH the totally OBSCENE amount of money that Apple is asking (new and pre-owned, both)?Absolutely not. By no stretch of the imagination is this smartphone THAT much more superior to other smartphones.My wife wanted only this particular phone, so we bought it for her (\"Happy Wife = a Happy Life\").  But it is, in all honesty, ridiculously overpriced and over-hyped. In my honest opinion.Best of luck to you with your decision...Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: littleseouls"
"Beautiful phoneI’m extremely pleased with this. Truly the best iPhone yet. I love the battery life, the cameras, the new gestures, the operative system, almost everything! There are some things that haven’t been addressed yet, like the compatibility of some apps with the new screen, or the absence of multitasking, but overall it’s a very smooth experience. I do not like the price tag though. If you can get a deal, you might be able to shave about $150 from the full retail price.

"Overall a great PhoneI bought the I Phone X out of the box. It had some barley noticeable imperfections on the screen. It was easy to set up and has a great display. The only thing is that the battery life is only 84% of when the phone was new. I would have expected a phone only a few years old to have greater battery capacity.

"The New iPhone XI was skeptical at first but the longer I have it, the better it gets. Facial ID set up in less than 30 seconds. The phone is blinding fast. Apple somehow figured out how to increase volume across the board so that is much better than my 7+. Battery life is better, too. After getting used to not having a control button, which didn’t take long at all, navigation is a snap. All in all, this is a phone that I can hold onto for a while - can’t imagine what’s coming next but I’ll be enjoying the X for months to come. I highly recommend the iPhone X.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: theronkeller"
"Worth the waitI had the iPhone 6s Plus before this bad boy. Although that phone was awesome, I'm glad I upgraded to the X. Went from a 64gb storage to 256gb. Happy to have purchased  a year after the release, as I got it heavily discounted on cyber Monday. Camera takes fast and clear photos, battery life is decent, and face ID is better than I thought it would be. The jury is still out on True Tone display but getting used to leaving that feature on, as it actually does help with reducing eye strain. I bought this phone refurbished in overall good condition.

"Cannot hear on this phoneI am not sure what to do- the phone’s volume is terrible. We bought two, and the phone’s speakers just can NOT be heard by either me or my husband.  We both can hear SOOO much better out of our iPhone 6. I am slightly hearing impaired, but even my husband, who hears well, has trouble hearing out of this phone, and it has no audio output jack to plug it into our (old-Bluetooth less) car or our portable speaker, so that it can be heard. Talking on the phone, or listening to a show or radio is a total exercise in frustration on this phone- I am sorely disappointed  :(.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: wireless_zone"

"Best camera, computer, phone, screen you can hold in your hand...in the WORLD!I've never seen a better screen with such rich, true-to-life colors than what I've seen on the iPhone X Edition. A smartphone is all about the screen. You can tell when you hold this phone in your hand and look at the screen this is the best in the world. I doubt Apple is making as much profit on each of these due to it's high cost to manufacture such a brilliant device. They've already admitted that it's a very low price for what they are getting. This is the phone people will keep for years. Who needs the upgrade program... just buy it to keep. And at last Apple has a smartphone that can be in water up to 30 minutes and it won't be ruined. I'm still going to treat mine like gold, but it's nice to know it's not so fragile in rain or if I accidentally drop it in water briefly. Those days of worry are gone with the X edition. Love it! One more thing: long battery life and wireless charging!!!Read full review...Verified purchase: No"
"Good value.Thin profile, and good size screen. Lots of storage. Overall good phone for the money.Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: buyspry"
"Just do itI have had the XR for 1 month now and I can say it's all positive. The battery life last all day long and sometimes I don't even charge for 2 days. (im not on it all the time and I keep my brightness at the lowest pretty much all day but still good battery life) All the functions on the phone work amazingly and even the condition of the phone they sent me was top notch. My favorite part is the storage! If you are going to get an apple phone please don't go with anything under 128gb bc they eat up the storage. The 256 is amazing Im not even close to filling it up and I have loads of apps and over 15000 pics and videos. The camera and all the features are ace as well. I upgraded to this from an iPhone 7 with 64gb that I HATED. So I would say if you're on the fence just do it! You won't regret the upgrade!Read full review...Product Reviews Images DialogProduct Reviews Images DialogProduct Reviews Images Dialog  Product Reviews Images DialogPrevious ImageNext ImageVerified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: bidallies"

"More technical problemsThis phone does not have a great phobe speaker. This is the third time I’ve ordered an iPhone and it’s always been something wrong with it I feel that perhaps used phones are rejects The last phone I bought people had a hard time hearing it from previous to that in a bad battery that I had to replace I’m not sure buying a used phone is worth itRead full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: bidallies"
